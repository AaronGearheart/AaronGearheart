## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

My name is **AaronGeareart** and I do random projects for fun.
My main coding language is Python although I use HTML, JS, and CSS for website design.
Most projects here are just passion projects made for automating tasks or solving problems.
While most of these seem fairly niche if these are useful to you feel free to use them.
Hopefully they can be useful to you as well!
